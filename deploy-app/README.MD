## Installation on k8s cluster
To install the application you can modify the manifests located under the `kubernetes` directory and run the `install` script

```bash
./install.sh
```

## Create your first user
After installing the application following the steps above, you can use the `seed.sh` script to create your frist user.

** Note: ** all the users created with the `seed.sh` script will be administrators.

```bash
kubectl exec -it <container_name> -- bash -c '/app/seed.sh'
```

## Configuration
There are a number of configuration parameters that you need to pay attention to, these parameters can be found under the `src/backend/constants.py` path.

```python
# GitHub constants
GITHUB_USER = os.getenv('GITHUB_USER', None)                          # GitHub username, used to clone the repository
GITHUB_API_TOKEN = os.getenv('GITHUB_API_TOKEN', None)                # GitHub API token, used to authenticate with the GitHub API
GITHUB_REPOSITORY_NAME = os.getenv('GITHUB_REPOSITORY_NAME', None)    # GitHub repository name, used to clone the repository
RELEASE_FILE_NAME = 'release.yaml'                                    # Release file name
VERSIONS_FILE_NAME = 'versions.yaml'                                  # Versions file name
GIT_COMMITER_NAME = os.getenv('GIT_COMMITER_EMAIL', None)             # Git commiter name
GIT_COMMITER_EMAIL = os.getenv('GIT_COMMITER_EMAIL', None)            # Git commiter email

# Other constants
SECRET_KEY = os.getenv('SECRET_KEY', None)                            # Secret key used to sign the JWT token
```

### Configuration parameters explained
1. `GITHUB_USER`, the username for the account that is going to be used to clone/pull the configuration repository
2. `GITHUB_API_TOKEN`, the personal access token for the user above
3. `GITHUB_REPOSITORY_NAME`, this is the name of the configuration repository and the format is: `username/repository-name` or `organization/repository-name`, you don't need the full URL to the repository.
4. `GIT_COMMITER_NAME`, this is the name associated with the commit in the configuration repository, it can be the same as the `GITHUB_USER`.
5. `GIT_COMMITER_EMAIL`, this is the email address associated with the github account of the commiter.
6. `SECRET_KEY`, this is a secret used to sign the JWT token, use an elaborate string, it could be a sha256 hash
